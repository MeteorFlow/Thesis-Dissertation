The project will focus on Ho Chi Minh City, a large urban area with a unique climate and significant impact on the daily lives of the community.

We will conduct research and collect data from multiple meteorological and hydrological monitoring stations in the city to ensure diversity and representation of local weather conditions. Once we have gathered sufficient data, we will proceed with preprocessing and standardizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency of the dataset. Finally, we will build an integrated database to store and manage information from various sources, creating a unified and reliable data source. The integrated information source will be used to provide multidimensional and detailed data on current weather conditions and short-term forecasts. The goal is to help the community and relevant entities better prepare for unpredictable weather fluctuations.

Hoaving an integrated database is expected to improve the effectiveness of weather forecasting models, enabling individuals and businesses to intelligently and safely cope with challenging weather conditions.
