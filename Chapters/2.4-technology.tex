\subsection{Kubernetes}
Kubernetes, an open-source system for managing and deploying highly flexible
applications in cloud and data center environments, has evolved into one of the
most widely adopted tools in the field of Information Technology \cite{k8s-doc}.
Originally developed by Google and later transferred to the Cloud Native
Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes aims to automate the deployment,
scaling, and management of containerized applications, alleviating the burden on
developers and system administrators. The platform offers a unified foundation
for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications across multiple
servers.

Kubernetes operates based on key concepts such as Pods, Services, ReplicaSets,
and various other abstractions, creating a flexible environment for application
deployment and management. This fosters an environment where developers can
easily build applications, and system administrators can efficiently maintain
them.

Beyond supporting traditional deployment models, Kubernetes paves the way for
innovative strategies like Continuous Deployment (CD) and Microservices. With
the ability to automate many aspects of the development and deployment process,
Kubernetes plays a crucial role in constructing and sustaining complex,
flexible, and scalable systems.

\subsubsection*{Kubernetes Components}
Introducing essential concepts for managing and deploying applications,
Kubernetes provides an effective and flexible environment. The main components
of Kubernetes include Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, and Service.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Images/3.4-k8s-comps.png}
    \caption{Overview of Kubernetes Components - Kubernetes}
    \label{fig:k8s-comps}
\end{figure}

In Kubernetes, a \textbf{Pod} serves as the fundamental unit, representing a
collection of containers that share a common workspace. Within the same Pod,
containers collaborate by sharing network and storage resources, fostering
interaction and enabling the construction of intricate applications.

The \textbf{ReplicaSet}, a crucial resource in Kubernetes, ensures a designated
number of Pods operate in a specified manner. In the event of a Pod failure or
shutdown, the ReplicaSet automatically initiates the creation of a new Pod to
replace it. This mechanism ensures the application's stable state by
guaranteeing a defined number of Pods are consistently operational.

For managing the deployment and updating processes of applications,
\textbf{Deployment} is a key component in Kubernetes. It articulates the desired
state of the application and orchestrates the updating of the ReplicaSet to
achieve that state. Deployment provides versatile management capabilities,
facilitating the deployment of new versions, rollbacks, and updates without
disrupting the service.

The \textbf{Service} resource in Kubernetes furnishes an HTTP port to Pods,
generating a unique IP address and DNS name for a cluster of Pods. This enables
seamless communication among applications within the cluster and with external
environments. Service effectively simplifies the intricacies of handling
multiple Pods and IP addresses, offering a straightforward means of accessing
services within the Kubernetes environment.

Typically, large-scale systems leverage Kubernetes in their software development
and deployment processes. This adoption brings several advantages, including
efficient resource management and self-recovery capabilities. Kubernetes
optimizes resource utilization, ensuring optimal performance and reducing waste.
Additionally, it automatically addresses issues during operations, enhancing
high availability.

However, the technology is not without its challenges, including a steep
learning curve for beginners. Mastery of diverse knowledge areas such as
computer networking and containerization is necessary. Moreover, deploying and
maintaining Kubernetes demands significant resources, both in terms of personnel
and hardware, particularly for smaller organizations.

\subsubsection*{High Availability in Kubernetes}
High Availability is a crucial factor in the success of any system. In
Kubernetes, High Availability is achieved through the combination of several
features, including self-healing, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

First, Kubernetes uses \textbf{Deployment}, a type of \textbf{Controller} for
managing replicas. Through Deployment, we can easily perform horizontal scaling,
which is the process of increasing the number of replicas of a Pod. This
mechanism ensures that the application can handle numerous requests without
compromising performance. Moreover, in case of a Pod failure, a Deployment makes
sure that a new Pod is created to replace it, ensuring the amounts of predefined
replicas is always maintained.

At network layers, Kubernetes uses \textbf{Service} for communication between
various components within or outside the cluster. Instead of directly accessing
Pods, other components can access Services, which will redirect the request to
the appropriate Pod. When Pods are replaced, the Service will automatically
update the routing rules to ensure the request is sent to the correct Pod.
Outside the cluster, Kubernetes also uses \textbf{Ingress} to manage external
access to Services. Instead of specifying the direct node IP address, Clients
can abstract it by using only the URL or hostname.

Finally, at the storage level, Kubernetes provides Persistent Volumes. By doing
so, applications can be agnostic to the underlying storage infrastructure. This
allows for easier management and scaling of storage resources. Not only that,
depending on the provided \textbf{Storage Class}, Kubernetes makes sure that the
data is replicated to multiple nodes, ensuring data availability in case of node
failure.

To summarize, Kubernetes provides a robust set of features to ensure High
Availability. By leveraging these features, we can build a highly available
system that can scale with our load, while also being resilient to failures.
