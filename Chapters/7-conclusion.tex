In this study, we have successfully built a Proof-of-Concept with high applicability, aiming to streamline the steps in the conventional workflow.
This is a crucial step towards optimizing and enhancing operational efficiency in both research and practical contexts.

Our goal was to create a flexible system with high adaptability, helping to simplify complex steps in the workflow.
In doing so, we not only contribute to increasing efficiency but also alleviate the workload pressure on personnel, creating favorable conditions for creativity and focus on core tasks.

We didn't just stop at developing the system but also proposed flexible deployment strategies, emphasizing easy integration into the current working environment of those involved in information gathering and weather forecasting tasks.
