The Weather Data Platform (WDP) is developed to become a comprehensive solution for harnessing the power of weather data. The system is designed to meet the specific requirements of meteorologists, scholars, academic researchers, and developers from various fields, including freelancers, businesses, and Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs). WDP serves as a centralized hub for integrating weather data, analysis, and various features.

With the desire to evolve into a Weather Data Platform, we aim for the perfection and diversification of weather information. Not just a data table but a comprehensive experience. In the future, in addition to continuing to build the proposed integrated database, we promise to further research to expand and develop this integrated database into a weather data platform with the following development directions:
\begin{enumerate}
    %\item Use Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methods like Agile to efficiently develop and deliver the product.
    %\item Differentiate between core and extended features.
    %\item Decide whether the product should be fixed or expandable.
    %\item Monitor and adopt new technologies in the weather and forecasting field to improve data quality and predictions.
    \item \textbf{Non-linear Data:} Expand beyond basic data integration, focusing on providing non-linear, detailed, and multi-source data to help users explore more about the surrounding environment.
    \item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence Understanding:} Use artificial intelligence to understand the language of weather, from minor changes to major events, creating a deep and intelligent weather information source.
    \item \textbf{Interactive User Interface:} Not just accessing information but also interacting with weather forecasts. The user interface will be where users express curiosity and interact directly with the data.
    \item \textbf{Geospatial Information Connection:} Leverage geographical information systems to provide a contextualized, localized view of weather forecasts. This helps users understand the impact of weather on their surroundings.
          %\item Build an integrated weather data, analysis, and other data sources platform.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Ensure quick and consistent responsiveness under all conditions.
    \item \textbf{Data Security:} Enhance data security to ensure the security and integrity of weather information.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Forecasting System:} Research and integrate artificial intelligence to improve forecasting capabilities and provide accurate forecast information.
    \item \textbf{Testing and Optimization:} Conduct system testing to ensure stability and address any potential issues. Optimize performance if necessary.
    \item \textbf{Deployment and Maintenance:} Deploy the system and maintain a regular update cycle to ensure that it consistently delivers accurate and reliable weather information.
